This is a first rough draft of some boilerplate combining many elements I keep rebuilding.

The stack is Yarn, Vite, Firebase, React, TypeScript, Unstated, Tailwind, Solidity, Ethers, Framer Motion, Docker, Cypress.

## Things to do on new project:

1. Before your app will load, you need to add firebase app data to firestore.config.ts
2. Modify the .firebaserc and set it up, I forget how to init, firebase login or use or something
3. Change images and logos in the public folder
4. Update the manifest from vite.config.ts
5. Update the meta description and title in index.html
6. Add or purge networks from hardhat.config.js
7. Purge demo.env and create .env, add your own env stuff
8. Change art and fill out heading tile
9. Remove firebase if not using auth; remove wallet if not using crypto.
